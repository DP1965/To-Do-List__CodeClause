# To-Do-List__CodeClause
This project is about keeping a track of your activities that you have mentioned in the list. Thanks to Code Clause for giving me this opportunity.
The To-Do List project is a simple and intuitive web application designed to help you keep track of your tasks and manage your daily activities. With the ability to add, complete, and remove tasks, this application makes it easy to stay organized and productive.
# Features
Task Management: Add tasks that you need to complete. Each task is displayed with a checkbox, the task description, and buttons for marking the task as complete or removing it.

Task Completion: Once you've completed a task, you can click the checkbox next to the task description. The checkbox will change its appearance to indicate that the task is complete, and the task description will change its color to red, making it easy to distinguish completed tasks from pending ones.

Task Removal: If you want to remove a task from your list, you can click the cross button next to the task description. This action will promptly remove the task from the list, helping you keep your list clean and focused on active tasks.
